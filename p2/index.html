 ! I decided not to overkill this time as I did in https://osalotioman.github.io/fortran_assignments/p1, keeping it simple.

 print *, "Enter the real number scores of the 10 students on the next 10 lines:"
 sum = 0.0
 do i = 1, 10
  read(*,12) scores(i, 1)
  sum = sum + scores(i, 1)
 end do
 avg = sum / 10

 print *, "Averager score: ",avg
12 format(f5.2)
end program csavg10
